                        <p>Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed. The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force. In my experience, there is no such thing as luck. Hey, Luke! May the Force be with you. The Force is strong with this one. I have you now. The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers.</p>

                        <p>Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead. You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you're going. I have traced the Rebel spies to her. Now she is my only link to finding their secret base. Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead. You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you're going. Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid.</p>

                        <p>Dantooine. They're on Dantooine. She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod. Send a detachment down to retrieve them, and see to it personally, Commander. There'll be no one to stop us this time! I don't know what you're talking about. I am a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan-- The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers. Dantooine. They're on Dantooine.</p>

                        <p>Don't act so surprised, Your Highness. You weren't on any mercy mission this time. Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies. I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you. In my experience, there is no such thing as luck. You mean it controls your actions? The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers. Leave that to me. Send a distress signal, and inform the Senate that all on board were killed.</p>
